## Resources required

COnsidering a team already has a dedicated designer, various team compositions are available to perform the specified taks. This team compositions may include outsourcing developers/outstaffing to optimise costs and balance the load between roles.

### Resource required - option 1

1. Senior Frontend React develop with experience in web3 development, NodeJS development for web servcer.
2. Backend developer, NodeJS stack
3. Senior QA - manual, with experience testing web3 applications
4. Senior/Middle Smart contract developer with experience build on Solidity and smart concract deployment

#### Resources required - option 2

1. Senior Frontend React develop with experience in web3 development, NodeJS development for web servcer.
2. Senior Smart contract and backend developer - former backend developer specializing in smart contracts on Solidity
3. Senior QA - manual, with experience testing web3 applications

#### Conclusion

Considering that there is not a lot of smart contract development for crowdloan campaign I would suggest moving with option 2, as it requires less people and less communication noise. It will alo help balance the load between the backend, smartcontract and frontend development.

#### Estimates

Provided with such team, I assume it would take between 3 weeks to 1 month of active developemtn and testing phase to deliver such project.
